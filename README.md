Getting Started

Tenzies is a dice game that is easy to understand and fun to play. It's built with React, leveraging advanced React features and best practices, which make it a great project for learning.
Game Rules

   Each player chooses a set of dice. Players hold all ten dice in their hands. Someone says “Go” and everyone rolls at the same time. Quickly look at your roll and decide which number you are going to go for. Put all your dice with that number aside, collect the remaining dice, and quickly roll again.  Keep rolling until all ten of your dice show the same number.
Game Features

    Components: The application uses a modular design with reusable React components.
    Event Listeners: Interaction with the game is handled using event listeners. This allows for a reactive user interface that responds to user input.
    Conditional Rendering: The application makes use of conditional rendering, showing or hiding elements based on the game state.
    Forms: Forms are used for starting a new game, inputting player names, and more.
    Side Effects: This application handles side effects using the React useEffect hook.
